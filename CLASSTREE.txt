A point is two or three scalar values that represent a position.
A movement is a direction quaternion value and a distance scalar value.
A vector is a point and a movement value.

- Quaternion [w, x, y, z]

- Movement [w, x, y, z]

- Point (abstract)
|- Point2D [x, y]
||- TexCoord (maybe not needed)

|- Point3D [x, y, z]
||- Vector [Movement] (overrides '<<' & '>>' operators)
|||- Volume (abstract)
||||- Box [x/y/z length]
||||- Cylinder [y height, radius]
